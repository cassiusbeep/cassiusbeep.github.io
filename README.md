## feedback from cs1300 studio crit time
- too much text on mobile (for table)
- more padding on text boxes!! bigger border radius? DONE
- title font too trippy - DONE
- background too trippy - 
 - maybe black transparent layer over it DONE (KINDA)
- padding on search bars - and then i can add border radius! DONE
- make back to top icon more clear! arrow in a circle or with more of a line - make it more clickable looking DONE
- mobile view stuck on side - possibly element stuck on a fixed width?
- menu should scroll 
- heading on side looks upside down on safari DONE MAYBE?
- maybe lines instead of colours for separating columns
- tool tip on numbers in calendar to show when a day hasn't been drawn on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- toggle input vs output - saves vertical space (might steal?)
- poss side menu on desktop instead of top menu (mobile?)
- horizontal scroll to compare different states/implementations?
- highlight elements you add or take away - green vs red? like Git diff
- device models figma plugin
- add more context - what's a component? what are the state models? etc.
