        In this small case study for my Interaction Design class I'm looking at different implementations of a common component &mdash; the search box and (optionally) the attached search suggestion list &mdash; and evaluating it for accessibility, discoverability, efficiency, & learnability. I'll use my findings from this investigation to practise my own design skills and exercise accessible interaction design for my own simple search box component.

        Since a search box's main goal is to take input from a user and provide results or feedback, it's important that a well designed component can work well with different input methods. In this part I take a look at the different states each component can go through, and then dive deeper into how it behaves when I provide input in various ways.
        <br/><br/>
        The first application I'm examining is Mozilla Firefox, my web browser of choice. The search bar of the app is located at the top of the window, and allows users to input URLs or search terms which can be directed to different search engines. The screencaps below show the component in various states: inactive, automatically focused (which happens when you open a new tab), focused on a click, and active (while text is being input).
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        The next application is <a href="https://citymapper.com/?lang=en" target="_blank">Citymapper</a>, a mobile and web navigation app. Citymapper's home page presents two fields for the start and end of a journey, inviting users to search for directions. Each one acts as a search box for locations looked up from Google Maps. I took screencaps of the top ("Start") field in inactive, focused, and active states.

      <p>
        Finally, I'm considering the Windows 11 File Explorer search bar, which allows users to search their local files. This component has different states for being inactive, hovered over, focused on a click, and active typing.

        Below is my reflection on interacting with each of these components with different input methods &mdash; mouse/touchpad, keyboard, and touchscreen. I'm asking the following questions:<br/><br/>
        <li>What's the interaction like? What distinguishes it from the other components?</li>
        <li>What functions does it have or not have?</li>
        <li>What functionalities are learnable, memorable, or efficient?</li>
        <li>How does each component compare in terms of accessibility?</li>

            &gt; Click to focus on search bar; opens suggestion list. <br/>
            &gt; List elements can each be hovered over and clicked. Clicking them populates the search bar with the item.<br/>
            &gt; Clicking outside closes list, but if you click close enough to its edge, the search field remains focused. <br/>
            Hovering over suggestions reveals a button which lets you remove the item. <br/>
            &gt; Typing changes the suggestions in the list (autocomplete) and an arrow button appears at the right to submit the input. On focus change, text remains there but the arrow disappears. <br/>
            &gt; Typing also causes a preview of autocomplete (highlighted text) to appear in the field itself. Clicking anywhere on autocompleted text confirms the autocomplete (so the text is in the field but not submitted).<br/>
            &gt; You can select a word with double click or the whole line with triple click. <br/>
            &gt; The right-click context menu allows clipboard actions.<br/>
            &gt; You can drag selected text over the "new tab" button above and create a new tab that automatically searches the text or opens it if it's a URL.<br/>
            &gt; The placeholder text is entirely non-interactable with the mouse.

            &gt; Tabbing onto the search box puts it in the "auto-focused" state I identified above, without opening the suggestion list.<br/>
            &gt; Pressing an up or down arrow key, PgUp, PgDown, or typing any character reveals the list.<br/>
            &gt; Typing causes autocomplete: Enter submits the current previewed autocomplete; Backspace deletes the previewed autocomplete; Left or Right accepts the previewed autocomplete but does not submit the search.<br/>
            &gt; Once the list is open, it can be navigated using the up and down arrow key or Tab/Shift+Tab (after the initial keypress, otherwise Tab will move off of the component), and Enter confirms/submits.<br/>
            &gt; Pressing Ctrl, Shift, or Alt changes the behaviour of the "Switch to tab" feature (Firefox opens a duplicate tab instead of switching to it). I only discovered this in the keyboard section but it also works in combination with hovering with the cursor.<br/>
            &gt; The discoverable-on-hover button from before is now visible when an item is selected with keys, and can be focused on with Tab (but not the arrow keys).

            &gt; On the mobile Firefox app (the closest I could get to the same context with a touchscreen device), the search bar is automatically focused which brings up the system keyboard. It contains a button for speech input and an icon of a QR code.<br/>
            &gt; When you start to type, a cross icon appears which you can tap to clear your input. This replaces the symbol for a QR code scanner, while the other icon in the bar (a microphone for voice search) remains in place.<br/>
            &gt; Typing also brings up the list of suggested searches. The system keyboard stays at the bottom of the screen (partially blocking the suggestions) until you start to scroll, which hides it.

      </table>

      <p>
        I found that some components were designed better than others when it came to discoverability and learnability. For example:
      </p>
      <ul class="left-list two-col">
        <li>I liked how Firefox implemented the option to delete a specific search suggestion as a button that appeared on hover, because it feels intuitive and easy to learn that moving your cursor to an object might reveal ways to interact with it. It was well designed because it appears no matter where on the element you hover.</li>
        <li>The option to toggle between two modes, one of which switches to an open tab and the other creates a duplicate of the tab, is not very discoverable. It's not hinted at anywhere that holding down Ctrl/Shift/Alt will toggle the duplicate tab mode. In fact, before I found this, I assumed that the "Switch to Tab" label on the list element was clickable and was the only button that would lead to switching tabs, while clicking elsewhere on the element would create a duplicate tab (which I assumed was the default behaviour). Instead, the only way to create a new tab is to hold one of these function keys. </li>
        <li>On the other hand, once the user knows this, it's quite easily memorable and efficient: the search bar makes it obvious when the Switch to tab mode is activated because the same label appears in the top text field where the current destination is normally set. Allowing any of the 3 keys lets people use whatever they remember.</li>
        <li>Both Citymapper and Explorer use a clear/delete button which appears only when the user starts to type. I think this successfully balances minimalism/avoiding clutter with discoverability, because the delete function is never needed until typing starts and then it appears immediately. The X symbol is pretty universal in deleting or closing something, so learnability is high here.</li>
        <li>The interactivity of symbols appearing inside the search bar is inconsistent across different contexts and not always easy to guess. The magnifying glass icon was not clickable in any of these examples, but I wondered whether I could click it to submit (performing the "search" action) &mdash; especially in File Explorer, where it's in the same place as Firefox's Arrow button.</li>
      </ul>

        My next goal is to see how each component provides output or feedback to the user's input. This output will take different forms for different users, for example based on whether they can perceive visual output, colour, or use audio i.e. with a screen reader.

            &gt; The active state of the search box is indicated by a blue border. Whenever the box is focused (i.e., when keyboard input will show up in the search bar), the background of the field is white instead of grey.<br/>
            &gt; Hovering over search suggestions, or the arrow button on the right, darkens the background colour of the item for visual feedback. <br/>
            &gt; Icons like the search engines at the bottom of the suggestion list have no label, but hovering reveals a tool tip with information about each option.<br/>
            &gt; The field provides a highlighted preview of the autocomplete prediction/search suggestion: if the user rejects it by pressing Backspace it disappears. If the user keeps typing, the preview changes to fit the new input. If the user presses an Arrow key the text stops being highlighted and looks the same as the user input to signal that it is part of the actual search term/URL now, and editable.

            &gt; On navigating onto the search bar with Tab, Windows 11 Narrator reads out the placeholder text: "Search with Google or enter address - combo edit collapse scan all new line"<br/>
            &gt; When Narrator is enabled, you are no longer able to open the suggestions list by pressing the up/down arrow, as it acts like Tab instead and moves to the next element on the browser. It does work once you start typing though.<br/>
            &gt; When you begin typing, Narrator reads each character typed and reads the remainder of the text (when the search bar auto-fills the field with a URL or search term).<br/>
            &gt; For each element of the list, when you Tab/arrow key onto it, Narrator reads out the name of the item, then "Visit", then a label for the index in the list - i.e., "1 of 10", and finally says "selected" to indicate that pressing Enter will submit that item.

The visual labels "Start" and "End" which give a hint that we're planning a journey are not accessible. <br/>
            &gt; When typing, Narrator reads the input and lets you use the arrow key to navigate onto the delete (X) button. You can also use the arrow keys to navigate the suggestion list, but Tab moves onto other elements on the page.

            &gt; It's not possible to access the clear/delete button (X) through key presss, and Tab leaves the component.

      <h2 id="part-3"><span>part 3: state models + component redesign <a href="accessible-components#whole-title" class="top-link">back to top</a></span></h2>
      <p>
        I'm most interested by the interaction flow of using Firefox's search bar implementation: I feel like it's the most feature-rich and complex, and also used so frequently as the primary interface to navigate the internet. <br/>
        <br/>
        To learn more about the design of this component and get ready to create my own version, I studied the different states that the Firefox search bar can be in and how users move between each one when using either mouse or keyboard inputs. 
      </p>

      <p>
        First was the state model diagram for mouse users. The diagram below shows how users move from the default state of the search box to focused, active input, and scrolling suggestions through hover and click actions. The dotted red line indicates a jump in states that can only occur using a keyboard: inputting your own search term or URL. Apart from this, the diagram captures the ways in which users can navigate suggested searches and buttons in the search bar component. Also note the label indicating the missing interaction for toggling "switch to tab" mode that I mentioned above: the only way to duplicate a tab instead of switching to it is via keyboard shortcuts. 
      </p>
