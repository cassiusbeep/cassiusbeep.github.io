      In this small case study I'm looking at different implementations of a common
      component &mdash; the search box and in some cases the attached suggestion list &mdash; and evaluating them
      for accessibility, discoverability, efficiency, & learnability. This small component is likely something you use
      one way or another every day, and is probably more complicated than you realise!<br />
      <br />
      To explore search bars in more depth, I'll be looking at different input methods, the ways different components
      provide output to the user, how the component moves through different states as you use it, and finally how the
      redesign process interfaces with accessibility and usability principles.
      I'll use my findings from this investigation to
      practise my own design skills and exercise accessible interaction design for a simple redesign proposal for the
      Firefox browser search bar.

      Since a search box's main goal is to take input from a user and provide results or feedback, it's important that a
      well designed component can work well with different input methods. In this part I take a look at the different
      states each component can go through, and then dive deeper into how it behaves when I provide input in various
      ways.
      <br /><br />
      The first application I'm examining is Mozilla Firefox, my everyday web browser. The search bar of the app is
      located at the top of the window, and allows users to input URLs or search terms which can be directed to
      different search engines. The screencaps below show the component in various states: inactive, automatically
      focused (which happens when you open a new tab), focused on a click, and active (while text is being input).

    </div>

    <p>
      The next application is <a href="https://citymapper.com/?lang=en" target="_blank">Citymapper</a>, a mobile and web
      navigation app. Citymapper's home page presents two fields for the start and end of a journey, inviting users to
      search for directions. Each one acts as a search box for locations looked up from Google Maps. I took screencaps
      of the top ("Start") field in inactive, focused, and active states.

    </div>

    <p>
      Finally, I'm considering the Windows 11 File Explorer search bar, which allows users to search their local files.
      This component has different states for being inactive, hovered over, focused on a click, and active typing.

      Below is my reflection on interacting with each of these components with different input methods &mdash;
      mouse/touchpad, keyboard, and touchscreen. I'm asking the following questions:<br /><br />
      <li>What's the interaction like? What distinguishes it from the other components?</li>
      <li>What functions does it have or not have?</li>
      <li>What functionalities are learnable, memorable, or efficient?</li>
      <li>How does each component compare in terms of accessibility?</li>

          focused. <br />
          Hovering over suggestions reveals a button which lets you remove the item. <br />
          &gt; Typing changes the suggestions in the list (autocomplete) and an arrow button appears at the right to
          submit the input. On focus change, text remains there but the arrow disappears. <br />

          &gt; Tabbing onto the search box puts it in the "auto-focused" state I identified above, without opening the
          suggestion list.<br />
          &gt; Pressing an up or down arrow key, PgUp, PgDown, or typing any character reveals the list.<br />
          &gt; Typing causes autocomplete: Enter submits the current previewed autocomplete; Backspace deletes the
          previewed autocomplete; Left or Right accepts the previewed autocomplete but does not submit the search.<br />
          &gt; Once the list is open, it can be navigated using the up and down arrow key or Tab/Shift+Tab (after the
          initial keypress, otherwise Tab will move off of the component), and Enter confirms/submits.<br />
          &gt; Pressing Ctrl, Shift, or Alt changes the behaviour of the "Switch to tab" feature (Firefox opens a
          duplicate tab instead of switching to it). I only discovered this in the keyboard section but it also works in
          combination with hovering with the cursor.<br />
          &gt; The discoverable-on-hover button from before is now visible when an item is selected with keys, and can

          typed (meaning the "Pick from Map" and "Use Current Location" options are inaccessible).<br />

          &gt; On the mobile Firefox app (the closest I could get to the same context with a touchscreen device), the
          search bar is automatically focused which brings up the system keyboard. It contains a button for speech input
          and an icon of a QR code.<br />
          &gt; When you start to type, a cross icon appears which you can tap to clear your input. This replaces the
          symbol for a QR code scanner, while the other icon in the bar (a microphone for voice search) remains in
          place.<br />
          &gt; Typing also brings up the list of suggested searches. The system keyboard stays at the bottom of the
          screen (partially blocking the suggestions) until you start to scroll, which hides it.

    <p>
      I found that some components were designed better than others when it came to discoverability and learnability.
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul class="left-list two-col">
      <li>I liked how Firefox implemented the option to delete a specific search suggestion as a button that appeared on
        hover, because it feels intuitive and easy to learn that moving your cursor to an object might reveal ways to
        interact with it. It was well designed because it appears no matter where on the element you hover.</li>
      <li>The option to toggle between two modes, one of which switches to an open tab and the other creates a duplicate
        of the tab, is not very discoverable. It's not hinted at anywhere that holding down Ctrl/Shift/Alt will toggle
        the duplicate tab mode. In fact, before I found this, I assumed that the "Switch to Tab" label on the list
        element was clickable and was the only button that would lead to switching tabs, while clicking elsewhere on the
        element would create a duplicate tab (which I assumed was the default behaviour). Instead, the only way to
        create a new tab is to hold one of these function keys. </li>
      <li>On the other hand, once the user knows this, it's quite easily memorable and efficient: the search bar makes
        it obvious when the Switch to tab mode is activated because the same label appears in the top text field where
        the current destination is normally set. Allowing any of the 3 keys lets people use whatever they remember.</li>
      <li>Both Citymapper and Explorer use a clear/delete button which appears only when the user starts to type. I
        think this successfully balances minimalism/avoiding clutter with discoverability, because the delete function
        is never needed until typing starts and then it appears immediately. The X symbol is pretty universal in
        deleting or closing something, so learnability is high here.</li>
      <li>The interactivity of symbols appearing inside the search bar is inconsistent across different contexts and not
        always easy to guess. The magnifying glass icon was not clickable in any of these examples, but I wondered
        whether I could click it to submit (performing the "search" action) &mdash; especially in File Explorer, where
        it's in the same place as Firefox's Arrow button.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="part-2"><span>part 2: output <a href="accessible-components#whole-title" class="top-link">back to
          top</a></span></h2>
    <p>
      My next goal is to see how each component provides output or feedback to the user's input. This output will take
      different forms for different users, for example based on whether they can perceive visual output, colour, or use
      audio i.e. with a screen reader.

          &gt; On click the box changes colour, highlights with a drop shadow, + brings up suggested searches.<br />
          &gt; The active state of the search box is indicated by a blue border. Whenever the box is focused (i.e., when
          keyboard input will show up in the search bar), the background of the field is white instead of grey.<br />
          &gt; Hovering over search suggestions, or the arrow button on the right, darkens the background colour of the

          &gt; Hovering or tabbing onto search suggestions auto-fills the search field with the full autocompleted
          phrase. <br />
          &gt; Icons like the search engines at the bottom of the suggestion list have no label, but hovering reveals a

          rejects it by pressing Backspace it disappears. If the user keeps typing, the preview changes to fit the new
          input. If the user presses an Arrow key the text stops being highlighted and looks the same as the user input

          &gt; When Narrator is enabled, you are no longer able to open the suggestions list by pressing the up/down
          arrow, as it acts like Tab instead and moves to the next element on the browser. It does work once you start
          typing though.<br />
          &gt; When you begin typing, Narrator reads each character typed and reads the remainder of the text (when the
          search bar auto-fills the field with a URL or search term).<br />
          &gt; For each element of the list, when you Tab/arrow key onto it, Narrator reads out the name of the item,
          then "Visit", then a label for the index in the list - i.e., "1 of 10", and finally says "selected" to
          indicate that pressing Enter will submit that item.

          "Start" and "End" which give a hint that we're planning a journey are not accessible. <br />
          &gt; When typing, Narrator reads the input and lets you use the arrow key to navigate onto the delete (X)

      I'm most interested by the interaction flow of using Firefox's search bar implementation: I feel like it's the
      most feature-rich and complex, and also used so frequently as the primary interface to navigate the internet.
      <br />
      <br />
      To learn more about the design of this component and get ready to create my own version, I studied the different
      states that the Firefox search bar can be in and how users move between each one when using either mouse or
      keyboard inputs. This displays the different ways the component will change visually or behaviourally depending on
      the sequence of actions a user takes.
    </p>

    <p>
      First was the state model diagram for mouse users. The diagram below shows how users move from the default state
      of the search box to focused, active input, and scrolling suggestions through hover and click actions. The dotted
      red line indicates a jump in states that can only occur using a keyboard: inputting your own search term or URL.
      Apart from this, the diagram captures the ways in which users can navigate suggested searches and buttons in the
      search bar component. Also note the label indicating the missing interaction for toggling "switch to tab" mode
      that I mentioned above: the only way to duplicate a tab instead of switching to it is via keyboard
      shortcuts.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an exercise in experience design and meaningful tradeoffs, I tried to come up with a design change for this
      state model that would provide some benefit to mouse users but a deliberate downside (in memorability,
      learnability, accessibility, or efficiency) for keyboard users. This redesign separates the "Switch to Tab"
      element from the main element in the suggestion list, creating a separate hoverable button so that two different
      functions are separate targets instead of a toggleable mode. This means that the default behaviour of clicking a
      suggested item in the list will create a new tab with that content, and only the "Switch to Tab" button itself
      will perform the tab switching behaviour.<br />
      <br />
      This redesign is a tradeoff in efficiency for keyboard users, as this separate focusable element provides friction
      when Tabbing through the list. A screen reader would have to read "Switch to Tab" between each individual search
      suggestion, which slows down navigation. However, it increases learnability and memorability for mouse users, as
      there is no longer an opaque keyboard shortcut for switching between the two tab navigation modes, but a clear
      button.

    <p>
      Next I created a state model diagram for keyboard users. This one captures more of the mechanics for typing and
      autocomplete, as well as the experience of tabbing through different parts of the component and how
      focusability/focus order affects the user flow.<br />
      <br />
      The cyclical "Typing" arrow from and to the "focused with list"
      state
      portrays the constant feedback loop of inputting characters and refining the suggestions in the list, but the
      state of the component does not change.
    </p>

      alt="Status model for Firefox search bar with keyboard" />

    <p>
      My redesign for the keyboard user experience removes the auto-focused state of the search bar which gives the
      field a blue border and allows text input but does not show the suggestion list. This means that when a new tab is
      opened or the search bar is Tab key-ed into, the list automatically pops up with suggestions for keyboard users to
      browse. <br />
      <br />
      This redesign is a tradeoff in accessibility and efficiency for mouse/trackpad users, because the list will hide
      content on the new tab page that the user may intend to click on. To
      mitigate this, the browser could close the list as soon as the user moves focus from the browser header (when the
      cursor moves down to the page).
      Regardless, it is less of a concern for keyboard users &mdash; especially those using screen readers &mdash;
      because
      they would need to Tab down to the main page to interact with that content anyway.<br />
      <br />
      The diagram also reflects the changes to the focus order made by my mouse state model redesign, and sacrifices the
      redundancy between the arrow and tab keys to create a quick/efficient way for keyboard users to exit the
      suggestion list and move to other components.

      alt="Status model for Firefox search bar with keyboard" />

    <p>
      With these changes in mind, I created a few sketches of a possible redesign for the Firefox search bar component
      that incorporate my critiques above. The first shows the initial state of the component upon opening a new tab,
      and the second is the state of the component when a keyboard user tabs onto the "Switch to tab" button on a list
      element. The annotations in the diagram explain more of my thoughts behind the redesign process.

    <p class="caption">Redesigned Firefox search bar: Switch to tab mode selected by Down Arrow-ing onto button</p>

    <p>
      Since it could be considered pretty arbitrary to change, I think I should justify my decision to make tab
      duplication rather than tab
      switching the "default" behaviour (i.e., the one that happens without pressing a dedicated button). I think that
      the majority of web browser users have a low number of webpages open, and tend to navigate purely by
      Tabbing/clicking between the visual handles at the top of the page.<br />
      <br />
      Most people will therefore not use the search bar workflow here to find an existing tab. Instead, I
      think if they perform the exact same action as they did to open the first tab, the same behaviour should occur. It
      makes more sense for those expecting a different result to learn one more step (clicking or tabbing to the button)
      than changing their behaviour to achieve the same result (opening a new tab).

    <ul class="left-list">
      After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iccWRhKZa8">Kat Holmes' talk on inclusive design</a> and
      thinking about her concept of "mismatch" in design,
      I've written down some thoughts about this study, my
      search component redesign, and how what I've learnt impacts accessibility in design. <br />
      <br />
      For the most part, the search components did well to create learnable and consistent behaviours that users can
      have high confidence in. For example, clearly telegraphing which item is focused
      is useful for all users, and in general the focus order was logical enough to be usable with
      a screen reader or a sole keyboard. Features like the clear field button, or
      filling in the field on hover/Tab, also make text input more accessible for users who may be fatigued by typing
      or eye strain.<br />
      <br />
      I tried to apply these features to my own design by emphasising the features I thought improved accessibility,
      keeping clear
      focus cues, autocomplete, and clear focus order.<br />
      <br />
      I did also find that some access needs weren't considered in all implementations. Some of the text
      in the Firefox search bar is quite low contrast which makes it less usable for those with visual impairments, so I
      used darker text in those places.
      There was a specific lack of consideration for screenreader users in the Citymapper implementation, where the
      focus order of the site didn't reflect the visual hierarchy at all and the search bar component did not provide
      any audio hints for its purpose or behaviour. This could be confusing for users who cannot read the separate label
      adjacent to the search bar and prevent them from using the navigation tool, so I used clear placeholder text to
      label the input field in my design. <br />
      <br />
      My design change addresses a mismatch between the existing Firefox design and the needs of users with decreased
      mobility or reach. Currently, the flow for toggling between the "switch tab" and "create new tab" modes require
      the user to hold down a key and press another key or click with the mouse (as well as being difficult to
      discover). By introducing a simpler one-click button for this behaviour, my design makes this
      action - which was likely intended to be effortless - more straightforward for a wider range of users. <br />
      <br />
      Opening the suggestion list as a default focused state increases usability for users who struggle to type,
      because their shortcuts and recent tabs are immediately available. <br />
      <br />
      The
      interactive magnifying glass button also allows mouse users to submit a URL or search without using the Enter
      key which may benefit those without access to a keyboard.<br />
      <br />
      I believe that able-bodied users who interact with a mouse and keyboard are the most prioritised and
      catered-to demographic when people create components. In my opinion, this neither represents the variety of people
      who will use these tools (keyboard users, screen reader users, eye tracker users, and more), nor does it account
      for the huge push toward touchscreen users in today's mobile-forward age. This can increase the friction in
      accessing a platform to the point or discouragement or complete inaccessibility (e.g. not being able to fill out
      and submit forms, navigate a site, or read important text). This exclusion can act upon anything from e-commerce
      to government resources, and further
      disadvantaging systemically deprioritised/marginalised people. <br />
      <br />
      Despite the simplicity of a search bar, it can act as a doorway to everything on the internet. Completing this
      study gave me a bit of insight into the importance of accessibility when designing these components and tools
      which mediate our online experiences.<br />
