      search bars are everywhere, and before this study i thought they were pretty much the <em>same</em> everywhere. in
      this study i consider the design of this component across different platforms and use what i find to design a new

      a search bar's main job is to take user input. let's take a look at how different bars change in response to our
      actions.
      <br /><br />
      firefox's search bar moves through 4 different states in response to user input:

      i wanted to know how these different implementations stack up in terms of interaction, functionality, and
      accessibility. i found that some components were designed better than others when it came to discoverability and
      learnability.
      for example:
      <!-- accessibility. below is a table with all my thoughts. -->

      <li>LIKE: firefox has a button to delete search suggestions, which appears on hover. it's intuitive and learnable
        because of the wide area that triggers it.</li>
      <li>DISLIKE: firefox's system of toggling between switch to tab/create new tab modes. it's not discoverable at
        all! I assumed clicking the "switch to tab" label would switch, while clicking elsewhere would create a new tab.
        instead, clicking anywhere will switch, and you have to hold specific keys to create a new tab.</li>
      <li>LIKE: both Citymapper and Explorer use a delete button which appears only when the user starts to type. this
        balances minimalism with discoverability</li>
      <li>DISLIKE: the interactivity of symbols inside the search bar is inconsistent across each app. every time, i
        hope i can click the magnifying glass to submit.</li>

      my next goal is to look at the output of components. how are they experienced by the user - and how does this
      change based on their unique perception? for example, if they perceive visual
      output, colour, or use
      audio i.e. with a screen reader. to link the input and output of components, i created state models describing how
      the firefox search bar changes as you use it.

          &gt; The active state of the search box is indicated by a blue border. Whenever the box is focused (i.e., when
          keyboard input will show up in the search bar), the background of the field is white instead of grey.<br />

          &gt; On navigating onto the search bar with Tab, Windows 11 Narrator reads out the placeholder text: "Search
          with Google or enter address - combo edit collapse scan all new line"<br />
          &gt; When Narrator is enabled, you are no longer able to open the suggestions list by pressing the up/down
          arrow, as it acts like Tab instead and moves to the next element on the browser. It does work once you start
          typing though.<br />
          &gt; When you begin typing, Narrator reads each character typed and reads the remainder of the text (when the
          search bar auto-fills the field with a URL or search term).<br />
          &gt; For each element of the list, when you Tab/arrow key onto it, Narrator reads out the name of the item,
          then "Visit", then a label for the index in the list - i.e., "1 of 10", and finally says "selected" to
          indicate that pressing Enter will submit that item.

          &gt; On navigating to the search bar with Tab, the Narrator reads "Edit - scan all - space," which does not
          convey any information about what should be typed into the field or what submitting will do. The visual labels
          "Start" and "End" which give a hint that we're planning a journey are not accessible. <br />
          &gt; When typing, Narrator reads the input and lets you use the arrow key to navigate onto the delete (X)
          button. You can also use the arrow keys to navigate the suggestion list, but Tab moves onto other elements on
          the page.

          <span class="mobile-label"><b>File Explorer</b><br /></span>
          &gt; On Tab-keying onto the search bar in the app header, the Narrator reads "Search Home," which provides a
          succinct description of the function of the component <br />
          &gt; Typing causes the Narrator to read the input character by character. <br />
          &gt; It's not possible to access the clear/delete button (X) through key presss, and Tab leaves the component.

          to the footer which contains more utility links. THEN it pops back up to look at the page's contents, starting
          with the "Start" search field and then the "End" field. This may be more practical for uses trying to complete
          a quick task on the website, but it doesn't match the visual order/priority of the page.<br />

      the diagram below shows how mouse users interact with the search bar's different states. the dotted

    <p>
      i did the same exercise for keyboard users. this captures typing and
      autocomplete, as well as the experience of tabbing through the component and how focus order affects the user
      flow.<br />
      <br />
      The cyclical "Typing" arrow from and to the "focused with list"
      state
      portrays the constant feedback loop of inputting characters and refining the suggestions in the list, but the
      state of the component does not change.

    <h2 id="part-2"><span>part 2: redesign <a href="accessible-components#whole-title" class="top-link">back to
          top</a></span></h2>

    <p>
      as an exercise in experience design and meaningful tradeoffs, I tried to come up with a design change for the
      mouse user state model that would provide some benefit to mouse users but a deliberate downside (in memorability,
      learnability, accessibility, or efficiency) for keyboard users. <br /><br />

      I separated the "Switch to Tab"
      element from the main element in the suggestion list, creating a separate button so that two different
      functions are separate targets instead of a toggleable mode. this means that the default behaviour of clicking a
      suggested item in the list will create a new tab with that content, and only the "Switch to Tab" button itself
      will perform the tab switching behaviour.<br />
      <br />
      now keyboard users have double the elements to tab through when navigating the list, but mouse users have more
      clarity in what their click will do.
    </p>
    <img class="ac-img" src="assets/accessible-components/status-model-mouse-redesign.png"
      alt="Redesigned Status model for Firefox search bar with mouse" />

    <p>
      my redesign for the keyboard user experience removes the auto-focused state of the search bar. this means that
      when a new tab is
      opened or the search bar is tabbed into, the list automatically pops up with suggestions for keyboard users to
      browse. <br />
      <br />
      this auto-focus would likely annoy mouse users, as it gets in the way of the page they're trying to click on. but
      it makes navigation faster for keyboard users.<br /><br />
      to mitigate the downside, the browser could close the list as soon as the user moves focus from the browser header
      (when the
      cursor moves down to the page).<br />
      <br />
      The diagram also reflects the changes to the focus order made by my mouse state model redesign, and sacrifices the
      redundancy between the arrow and tab keys to create a quick/efficient way for keyboard users to exit the
      suggestion list and move to other components.
    </p>
    <img class="ac-img" src="assets/accessible-components/status-model-keyboard-redesign.png"
      alt="Status model for Firefox search bar with keyboard" />

    <p>
      with these changes in mind, I sketched a possible redesign for the Firefox search bar component
      that incorporate my critiques above. the first shows the initial state upon opening a new tab,
      and the second is the state when a keyboard user tabs onto the "Switch to tab" button on a list
      element. the annotations in the diagram explain more of my thoughts behind the redesign process.
    </p>

      alt="Switch to tab mode of redesigned Firefox search bar" />
    <p class="caption">redesigned firefox search bar: Switch to tab mode selected by down arrow-ing onto button</p>

    <p>
      i decided to make tab
      duplication rather than tab
      switching the "default" behaviour. I think that
      the majority of web browser users have a low number of webpages open, and tend to navigate purely by
      Tabbing/clicking between the visual handles at the top of the page.<br />
      <br />
      therefore, most people won't use the existing search bar workflow to find an existing tab. I
      think if they perform the exact same action as they did to open the first tab, the same behaviour should occur.
      <br />
      <br />
      It makes more sense for those expecting a different result to learn one more step (clicking or tabbing to the
      button)
      than changing their behaviour to achieve the same result (opening a new tab).
    </p>

    <p>overall, this case study gave me an excuse to dive deeper in one of the most widely used components we have, and
      think more deliberately about how i can implement it in future.</p>
