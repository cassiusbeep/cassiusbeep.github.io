      <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/ontra-mobility">Ontra Mobility</a> is a startup who participated in
      YCombinator S24. <a href="iterative#part-3">Our team</a> found Ontra through the YCombinator demo day listing and
      were intrigued by their vision of improving public transport systems for the modern day. This is a cause that is
      close to all our hearts and we hoped to bring our own perspectives as transit users and future tech workers!<br />
      <br />
      This case study will show
      how we used iterative design processes to develop a prototype for Ontra's mobile app based on their mission.

    <p>
      The problem that Ontra seeks to address is the the need to adapt public transport systems to
      serve wide urban/suburban areas while dealing with huge budget cuts. <br />
      <br />
      Ridership has dropped, but reducing frequency only makes it worse, so Ontra seeks to design high-frequency transit
      routes and combine them with on-demand ridesharing to serve changing public needs in real time and reduce spending
      on less-used routes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ontra uses data about public transit ridership to <b>optimise the system</b> in real time and suggest improvements
      to city transport. <br />
      <br />
      It also acts as a navigation tool, <b>planning rider journeys</b> "with the best combination of
      transit options available." They show a strong focus on integrating <b>on-demand ridesharing platforms</b> with
      other modes of transport.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      We explored various combinations of these two goals as we sketched different approaches to an app for Ontra.
      <br />
      <br />
      The
      goal here is not to create a polished interface, but to quickly explore a wide range of ideas from our whole team
      and identify what we like. <br />
      <br />
      This first step also helped us to unify our understanding of Ontra as a company.

    <p>
      We used our critique of each sketch to create a wireframe incorporating our favourite features into a single
      design.
    </p>

    <div class="hor-scroll">

    <p class="caption">Balsamiq Wireframe for Ontra Mobility App <em>(scroll right)</em></p>

    <ul class="left-list">
      what we <b>kept</b> from our sketches:<br />
      <br />
      <li>homepage <b>congestion info</b>, because it updates users at a glance, as well as the map, for familiarity and
        quick
        view of nearby buses etc.</li>
      <li>integrated <b>rideshare booking</b>, because it serves Ontra's goals</li>
      <li>clean design and casual/conversational tone</li>
      <li>option to <b>rate your journey</b>, to provide useful data on Ontra's algorithms</li>
      <li>night transit mode, as a helpful feature for users out and about who need to plan their journey home</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="left-list">
      what we <b>changed</b> from our sketches:<br />
      <br />
      <li>removed obtrusive login/<b>data collection</b> prompts, as it can slow down users and feel irrelevant to their
        task
      </li>
      <li>option to "regenerate"/see multiple routes: Ontra's focus is on <b>providing ONE clear path</b></li>
      <li>added a way to change journey's start location, in case they're planning ahead</li>
      <li>added more focus on the <b>transition between public transport & on-demand travel</b> (screen 6)&mdash;this is
        underserved in
        most travel apps and is a unique selling point of Ontra</li>
      <li>removed the whole page for night transit mode and made it a push-notification reminder instead (set by the
        user at the end of a journey)</li>
      <li>focused more on the <b>user navigation</b> side of Ontra (rather than the city-official-side travel
        optimisation), to define our scope and
        include more detail.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Overall, we aimed for a confident and streamlined navigation tool that efficiently
      directs users through routes with both public transport and on-demand rideshare services.
    </p>

    <h2 id="part-3">
      <span>part 3: creating a prototype <a href="iterative#whole-title" class="top-link">back to

    </h2>

    <p>
      Before building our high-fidelity prototype, we sought out feedback on our wireframe.
    </p>

    <ul class="left-list">
      <b>we found that:</b> <br />
      <br />
      <li>our header didn't provide much info. we can remove the "Ontra" title and use the header to give <b>context to
          the current screen</b>.</li>
      <li>the delay info on the homepage is not that clear. the colours are memorable but a tutorial or hover tooltip
        would make them more learnable.</li>
      <li>we should use the <b>colour coding</b> elsewhere to be cohesive and consistent.</li>
      <li>we need to clarify what <b>night transit mode</b> does</li>
      <li>the buttons in the <b>bottom navbar</b> don't make much sense.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We kept all these critiques in mind as we created a prototype for the app in Figma. The aim of this prototype is
      to approximate the final app and demonstrate usability for a typical task within Ontra.
    </p>

    <p class="mobile-iframe">
      <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); aspect-ratio: 9/16;" height="100%"

    <p>
      how did we incorporate our feedback?<br /><br />

      justify design choices<br /><br />

      did we solve the original problem?<br /><br />

      mention bug with prototype which is a <a
        href="https://forum.figma.com/suggest-a-feature-11/prevent-interaction-hotspots-from-triggering-below-fixed-elements-35236"
        target="_blank">known figma issue</a>: scrollable interactable content will be triggered when
      you click an item that's on top of it/hiding it (which means sometimes clicking the locations in the "Go anywhere"
      dropdown takes you tp the info pages instead).

    </h2>

    <p>
      Next, we conducted usability tests with our prototype to determine how successful our design would be. We
      instructed our participants to use our app to navigate from their current location to Waterman Street, and
      observed/recorded how they tried to complete that task with our interface.

    <ol class="left-numlist">
      The typical subtasks in this process were:<br />
      <br />
      <li>one</li>

    <ul class="left-list">
      The typical user errors we observed were:<br />
