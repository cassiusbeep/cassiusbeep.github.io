      <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/ontra-mobility">Ontra Mobility</a> is a startup who participated in
      YCombinator S24. <a href="iterative#end">our team</a> found Ontra through the demo day listing and
      were intrigued by their vision of improving public transport systems for the modern day. This is a cause close to
      all our hearts and we hoped to bring our own perspectives as transit users and designers!

    <p>
      The problem that Ontra seeks to address is the the need to adapt public transport systems to
      serve wide urban/suburban areas while dealing with huge budget cuts. <br />
      <br />
      Ridership has dropped, but reducing frequency only makes it worse, so Ontra seeks to design high-frequency transit
      routes and combine them with on-demand ridesharing to serve changing public needs in real time and reduce spending
      on less-used routes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ontra uses data about public transit ridership to <b>optimise the system</b> in real time and suggest improvements
      to city transport. <br />
      <br />
      It also acts as a navigation tool, <b>planning rider journeys</b> "with the best combination of
      transit options available." They show a strong focus on integrating <b>on-demand ridesharing platforms</b> with
      other modes of transport.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      We explored various combinations of these two goals as we sketched different approaches to an app for Ontra.
      <br />
      <br />
      The
      goal here is not to create a polished interface, but to quickly explore a wide range of ideas from our whole team
      and identify what we like. <br />
      <br />
      This first step also helped us to unify our understanding of Ontra as a company.

    <h2 id="part-2"><span>part 2: building a wireframe <a href="iterative#whole-title" class="top-link">back to
          top</a></span></h2>

    <p>
      I worked with some team members to build a wireframe incorporating our favourite features into a single design,
      using Balsamiq Cloud.
    </p>

    <ul class="left-list">
      i worked on synthesizing our sketches and feedback into a list of features to keep in our wireframe: <br />
      <br />
      <li>homepage <b>congestion info</b>, because it updates users at a glance, as well as the map, for familiarity and
        quick
        view of nearby buses etc.</li>
      <li>integrated <b>rideshare booking</b>, because it serves Ontra's goals</li>
      <li>clean design and casual/conversational tone</li>
      <li>option to <b>rate your journey</b>, to provide useful data on Ontra's algorithms</li>
      <li>night transit mode, as a helpful feature for users out and about who need to plan their journey home</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="left-list">
      i also collated the features we disliked across each sketch:<br />
      <br />
      <li>removed obtrusive login/<b>data collection</b> prompts, as it can slow down users and feel irrelevant to their
        task
      </li>
      <li>option to "regenerate"/see multiple routes: Ontra's focus is on <b>providing ONE clear path</b></li>
      <li>added a way to change journey's start location, in case they're planning ahead</li>
      <li>added more focus on the <b>transition between public transport & on-demand travel</b> (screen 6)&mdash;this is
        underserved in
        most travel apps and is a unique selling point of Ontra</li>
      <li>removed the whole page for night transit mode and made it a push-notification reminder instead (set by the
        user at the end of a journey)</li>
      <li>focused more on the <b>user navigation</b> side of Ontra (rather than the city-official-side travel
        optimisation), to define our scope and
        include more detail.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="caption">Balsamiq Wireframe for Ontra Mobility App <em>(scroll right)</em></p>

    <p>
      Overall, we aimed for a confident and streamlined navigation tool that efficiently
      directs users through routes with both public transport and on-demand rideshare services.
    </p>

    <h2 id="part-3">
      <span>part 3: creating a prototype <a href="iterative#whole-title" class="top-link">back to
          top</a></span>
    </h2>

    <p>
      Before building our high-fidelity prototype, we sought out feedback on our wireframe.
    </p>

    <ul class="left-list">
      <b>we found that:</b> <br />
      <br />
      <li>our header didn't provide much info. we can remove the "Ontra" title and use the header to give <b>context to
          the current screen</b>.</li>
      <li>the delay info on the homepage is not that clear. the colours are memorable but a tutorial or hover tooltip
        would make them more learnable.</li>
      <li>we should use the <b>colour coding</b> elsewhere to be cohesive and consistent.</li>
      <li>we need to clarify what <b>night transit mode</b> does</li>
      <li>the buttons in the <b>bottom navbar</b> don't make much sense.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I kept all these critiques in mind as I collaborated with the team on our prototype for the app in Figma. The aim
      of this prototype is
      to approximate the final app and demonstrate usability for a typical task within Ontra. I was responsible for
      setting up the layout of the main pages, creating some
      of the reusable components, and implementing the interactive/navigational elements of our prototype.
    </p>

    <iframe class="mobile-iframe" style="aspect-ratio: 9/16;"
      src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/6wYABSS1rKglwD8jQQy9gV/Ontra?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1-2&footer=false&viewport=87%2C140%2C0.43&scaling=contain&content-scaling=fixed&embed-host=share"
      allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <ul class="left-list">
      In response to our feedback, we: <br /><br />
      <li>
        created more informative titles for each page
      </li>
      <li>
        added similar colour coding to the homepage map as the delay information panel, and added tooltips on press-down
        to indicate congestion levels
      </li>
      <li>
        we made the decision to remove the page for night transit mode and updated the navbar to match.
      </li>
      <br />

      one bug with our prototype is a <a
        href="https://forum.figma.com/suggest-a-feature-11/prevent-interaction-hotspots-from-triggering-below-fixed-elements-35236"
        target="_blank">known figma issue</a>: sometimes clicking on suggested search results will trigger the delay
      cards below.
    </ul>

      <span>part 4: user testing <a href="iterative#whole-title" class="top-link">back to
          top</a></span>
    </h2>

    <p>
      Next, we conducted usability tests with our prototype to determine how successful our design would be. We
      instructed our participants to use our app to navigate from their current location to Waterman Street, and
      observed/recorded how they tried to complete that task with our interface.
    </p>

    <ol class="left-numlist">
      The typical subtasks in this process were:<br />
      <br />
      <li>Open the Ontra app.</li>
      <li>Tap the search box ("Go anywhere")</li>
      <li>Read the suggestions and tap the correct destination</li>
      <li>Read the suggested route and tap "Let's go"</li>
      <li>After this step, users diverged: some felt the objective was completed at this point and stopped the task.
      </li>
      <li>Others read the next screen and continued to reserve a pickup at their station.</li>
      <li>They then reached the destination page and left a star rating.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul class="left-list">
      Some user errors or misunderstandings we observed:<br />
      <br />
      <li>When the route was originally served (before clicking "let's go"), some expected that each item on-screen was
        an alternative transit method and attempted to select one.</li>
      <li>Users were confused by the "reserve a pickup" option, and weren't sure where they were being picked up from or
        driven to.</li>
      <li>It was hard for users to tell how far through the journey they were.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In general, users did well at the start of this task and it matched their expectations. Later in the task, where
      users had to transition from public transit to ridesharing services, there was more hesitance and confusion.
    </p>

    <ul class="left-list">
      Some other user feedback and responses to questions:<br />
      <br />
      <li>The map view could be more immersive and descriptive.</li>
      <li>The interface is overall simple and learnable, especially with clear iconography and calls to action.</li>
      <li>Users appreciated the conversational tone of the app.</li>
      <li>Users expected explicit confirmation of ridesharing bookings. </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="left-list">
      This was an invaluable exercise for testing our own assumptions of our design and identifying next steps for the
      process if we were to continue developing an app for Ontra Mobility. Based on these results, we might consider
      making the following changes to our interface:<br />
      <br />
      <li>Making the initial directions clearer/more descriptive, and highlighting transition points between different
        modes of transit.</li>
      <li>Clearly marking progress through the user's journey.</li>
      <li>Adding more visual feedback to the booking process, and a confirmation page.</li>
    </ul>
