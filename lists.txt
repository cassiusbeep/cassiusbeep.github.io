meals i've enjoyed recently
shakshouka - i'd never had this before but i made it for brunch today (june 2 2024) and i am a big fan
summer rolls - i had them twice and became obsessed, so i bought a pack of rice paper and now i have no choice but to be obsessed because there are a lot left.
samosa chaat from chai stix (link)
affogato al caffe
