      This case study aims to analyse the weaknesses of an existing webpage and help me develop the
      skills needed to create prototypes for a responsive redesign and eventually develop a working responsive website
      that adapts to
      different screen sizes.

      The webpage I've selected is Art Crimes at <a href="https://www.graffiti.org/" target="_blank"
        title="Art Crimes">graffiti.org</a>, an archive of
      graffiti and graffiti artists from around
      the world. It
      also hosts articles and other resources relating to graffiti culture and news. This site has been going a long
      time, and has actually split off from the historic version at <a href="http://www.graffitiarchiv.org/"
        target="_blank" title="Art Crimes Archive">graffitiarchiv.org</a> &mdash; this site doesn't
      load for me but you may have better luck! The version I'm looking at is labelled the "future-facing" Art
      Crimes website.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first task is to identify any significant choices or drawbacks in the design of this website, focusing on
      <b>efficiency, learnability,</b> and <b>memorability</b>.
    </p>

    <ul class="left-list">
      <b>efficiency:</b>
      <li>inefficient for keyboard/screen reader users: really long list to
        tab through - no shortcuts.</li>
      <li>search bar at bottom might be inefficient.</li>
      <li>the search bar is too short - doesn't even show the whole placeholder. annoying for longer search terms.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="left-list">
      <b>learnability:</b>
      <li>navigation is quite learnable for mouse users: all options are presented flatly (no nested menus, so no having
        to figure out which submenu your specific option is located under)</li>
      <li>the main image is linked (not obviously) to a larger version of the image which is hard
        to tell without prior knowledge.</li>
      <li>the high-level shape of the page doesn't really match natural reading patterns (the F-shape), so
        first-time visitors might have trouble orienting themselves.</li>
      <li>it took me a second to realise the significance of the list of names on the right of the page (titled "March
        2017"). it also wasn't clear that the "Previous months" list is connected.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="left-list">
      <b>memorability:</b>
      <li>it might be hard to remember the location of frequently used links since they're just in a long list rather
        than
        spatially distributed.</li>
      <li>there's not much going on within the page so generally pretty memorable. i'd like to preserve this simplicity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>what is the conceptual model of graffiti.org?</b><br />
      <br />
      Art Crimes aims to be a kind of hub or central navigation point for all things graffiti. This
      homepage should allow visitors to explore freely around artists and archives if they have a general interest, or
      quickly navigate to specific resources if they know what they want to find. There's also an element of trying to
      showcase different artists - maybe their art should be more accessible from the list, to encourage exploration and
      discovery?
    </p>

    <ul class="left-list">
      I also used WebAIM WAVE to detect possible accessibility problems. It highlighted that:<br />
      <br />
      <li>there isn't a clear heading hierarchy, with the largest heading being H2 and no subheadings below that.</li>
      <li>the site uses spacer images without alt text.</li>
      <li>their HTML file doesn't specify a language or is invalid.</li>
      <li>they include a linked image (which I mention above) without alt text, so the link is "empty".</li>
      <li>the page uses very small text in the footer for copyright information and acknowledgements.</li>
      <li>the page layout is mainly dictated by layout tables, which I feel are kind of old school and might not be best
        practice for modern layouts.</li>
      <br />
      I also separately noticed that the page lacks H1 headings because an images/logo is used as the main title. I
      understand the appeal for an art-focused website, but the
      accessibility and navigability can definitely be improved.
    </ul>

    <h2 id="part-2"><span>part 2: visual redesign <a href="redesign#whole-title" class="top-link">back to
          top</a></span></h2>

    <p>
      Before creating high definition prototypes for my redesign across different platforms, I put together a visual
      design style guide that shows the main elements I'd be using. This includes important reusable components, my
      colour palette, and typography choices.
    </p>

    <p class="compact">
      <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); aspect-ratio: 4/2.5;" width="100%"
        src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/uuWsmJbpxsb71MWfRqzUpk/Responsive-Redesign?page-id=2%3A5&node-id=2-6&footer=false&viewport=87%2C140%2C0.43&scaling=contain&content-scaling=fixed&hide-ui=1&embed-host=share"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>

    <!-- <img class="ac-img" src="assets/redesign/visual_guide.png"> -->

    <ul class="left-list">
      This guide includes the components I intend to use throughout the redesign, including variants for different
      states:
      <li>Responsive components like hoverable links, interactive buttons - these make behaviours to user actions more
        predictable.</li>
      <li>Collapsed menu into dropdowns to simplify navigation.</li>
      <li>Kept the colour scheme consistent (minimal -- there's lot of colour in the graffiti!)</li>
      <li>Updated typefaces to make them legible but still stylistic</li>
      <li>Removed uses of images as tites or spacers, especially without alt text.</li>
      <li>Removed the separate style/colour for visited links (no more purple links) based on user feedback that it's
        confusing/unhelpful</li>
      <li>Queries the user's ability to hover to remove some buttons specifically on touchscreens</li>
      <li>Slightly enlarge images on hover to hint at the click-to-maximise feature</li>
      <br />
      The interactive prototypes are below (may take time to load).
    </ul>

    <p>
      The annotated versions below indicate the design choices I made and explain how I was thinking about making the
      page responsive to different zoom and screen sizes at this stage.<br /><br />
      Since the existing site does not scale at all in response to changing font or screen sizes, I introduced grid
      layouts (which can stack elements on narrower screens) and variably sized image elements to improve
      visibility.<br /><br />
      Not pictured in the annotations for clarity is the overarching grid layout of the whole body of the page, which
      would be a single column. I use this to limit the width of the centrally scrolling page contents in case of
      ultra-wide screens.

    <p>
      Using my critiques from the earlier parts and the style guide/prototypes I built in Figma, I went on to build a <a
        href="./art-crimes">working, responsive version</a> of my redesigned webpage for Graffiti.org. The links in my
      prototype are hooked up and <b>will lead you to pages in the real website</b>, so feel free to explore and see how
      the
      navigation feels compared to the original homepage.

    </p>
    <p class="caption">Graffiti.org Redesign: Homepage</p>

    <ul class="left-list">
      Here are some of the choices I made to improve usability and accessibility:<br />
      <li>Implemented variable image sizes and grid configurations for different screen/font sizes</li>
      <li>Re-organised headings and content to fit user expectations and introduce the site better</li>
      <li>Made menu navigation more logical and streamlined</li>
      <li>Used tab index and JS event listeners to improve keyboard navigation (try tabbing through the navbar!)</li>
      <li>Added alt-text to images, removed spacer images, and used a consistent header hierarchy.</li>
      <br />
      I think my design is pretty effective at preserving the visual brand of the Art Crimes organisation while
      improving the overall user experience and drawing people in to explore the archives.
    </ul>

    <p>
      I had a fun time redesigning this webpage and thinking about how simple design choices and responsiveness testing
      can improve the end user experience. Going through critique was also a great opportunity to identify blind spots
      in my process. Maybe one day Graffiti.org will use some of these ideas for a redesign!<br />
