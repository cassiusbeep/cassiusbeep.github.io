      This case study aims to analyse the weaknesses of an existing webpage and help me develop the
      skills needed to create prototypes for a responsive redesign and eventually develop a working responsive website
      that adapts to
      different screen sizes.

      The webpage I've selected is Art Crimes at <a href="https://www.graffiti.org/" target="_blank"
        title="Art Crimes">graffiti.org</a>, an archive of
      graffiti and graffiti artists from around
      the world. It
      also hosts articles and other resources relating to graffiti culture and news. This site has been going a long
      time, and has actually split off from the historic version at <a href="http://www.graffitiarchiv.org/"
        target="_blank" title="Art Crimes Archive">graffitiarchiv.org</a> &mdash; this site doesn't
      load for me but you may have better luck! The version I'm looking at is labelled the "future-facing" Art
      Crimes website.

    <p>
      My first task is to identify any significant choices or drawbacks in the design of this website, focusing on
      <b>efficiency, learnability,</b> and <b>memorability</b>.
    </p>

    <ul class="left-list">
      <b>efficiency:</b>
      <li>it might be inefficient for those using keyboard/screen readers as it's essentially just a really long list to
        tab through - no shortcuts.</li>
      <li>having the search bar at bottom might be kind of inefficient.</li>
      <li>the search bar is really short - it doesn't even show the whole placeholder. this is annoying for longer
        search
        terms.</li>
      <br />
      <b>learnability:</b>
      <li>the navigation is quite learnable for mouse users as all options are presented equally (no nested menus, so no
        having to
        figure out which submenu your specific option is located under)</li>
      <li>the large image is linked, which is not obvious. it just links to a larger version of the image which is hard
        to tell without prior knowledge.</li>
      <li>the high-level shape of the page doesn't really match our natural reading patterns (the F-shape), so
        first-time visitors might have trouble orienting themselves.</li>
      <li>it took me a second to realise the significance of the list of names on the right of the page (titled "March
        2017"). it also wasn't clear that the "Previous months" list is connected to this list.</li>
      <br />
      <b>memorability:</b>
      <li>it might be hard to remember the location of frequently used links since they're just in a long list rather
        than
        spatially distributed.</li>
      <li>there's not much going on within the page so generally pretty memorable. i'd like to preserve this simplicity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>what is the conceptual model of graffiti.org?</b><br />
      <br />
      Art Crimes aims to be a kind of hub or central navigation point for all things graffiti. This
      homepage should allow visitors to explore freely around artists and archives if they have a general interest, or
      quickly navigate to specific resources if they know what they want to find. There's also an element of
      - trying to showcase different artists - maybe their art should be more accessible from the list?
    </p>

    <ul class="left-list">
      I also used WebAIM WAVE to detect possible accessibility problems. It highlighted that:<br />
      <br />
      <li>there isn't a clear heading hierarchy, with the largest heading being H2 and no subheadings below that.</li>
      <li>the site used some spacer images - e.g., between the body and footer - without alt text.</li>
      <li>their HTML file doesn't specify a language or is invalid.</li>
      <li>they include a linked image (which I mention above) without alt text, so the link is "empty".</li>
      <li>the page uses very small text in the footer for copyright information and acknowledgements.</li>
      <li>the page layout is mainly dictated by layout tables, which I feel are kind of old school and might not be best
        practice for modern layouts.</li>
      <br />
      Separately from the WAVE toolkit, I noticed that the reason the page lacks H1 headings is because an images/logo
      is used as the main title. I understand the appeal of this decision for an art-focused website, but for
      accessibility and navigability it can definitely be improved.
    </ul>

    <h2 id="part-2"><span>part 2: visual redesign <a href="redesign#whole-title" class="top-link">back to
          top</a></span></h2>

    <p>
      Before creating high definition prototypes for my redesign across differen platforms, I put together a visual
      design style guide that shows the main elements I'd be using. This includes important reusable components, my
      colour palette, and typography choices.
    </p>

    <img class="ac-img" src="assets/redesign/visual_guide.png" alt="Visual style guide for my redesigned page" />

    <p>
      This guide includes the components I intend to use throughout the redesign, including variants on the components
      for other states like hover and after click. I tried to create more responsive components like links that change
      colour on hover and coloured buttons, to make user actions on the site more confident and predictable. <br />
      <br />
      I kept the colour scheme quite consistent with the existing minimal palette since a lot of colour will come from
      the artwork itself. However, I updated the typefaces quite
      significantly
      to introduce faces that could provide the same stylistic energy as the image headings while still being legible by
      the eye and screen readers.<br />
      <br />
      Finally, I introduced an animated component (with light and dark variants) which stretch on hover to indicate that
      images
      can be enlarged with a click.

    <!-- 
      Before you start your hi-fi prototypes, create a visual design style guide (e.g., in Figma) that displays the main
      colors, typography, and reusable componentsâ€™ different states
      (buttons on hover, click, etc.)

      Major components should be included in your style guide, but how many components this totals to will vary based on
      your design choices. For interactive elements (e.g., elements that change on hover, on click), keep their
      interactions consistent throughout your product to keep the user experience coherent. You may find using Figma
      components helpful for reusing components in your hi-fi prototype.

    <p>
      Using my critiques from the earlier parts and the style guide/prototypes I built in Figma, I went on to build a <a
        href="./art-crimes">working, responsive version</a> of my redesigned webpage for Graffiti.org.
