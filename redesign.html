      This case study aims to analyse the weaknesses of an existing webpage, graffiti.org, and help me develop the
      skills needed to create prototypes for a responsive redesign and eventually develop a working responsive website
      that adapts to
      different screen sizes.

      The webpage I've selected is graffiti.org, an archive of graffiti and graffiti artists from around the world. It
      also hosts articles and other resources relating to graffiti culture and news.

      Find problems in efficiency, learnability, and memorability<br />
      <br />
      think about its conceptual model<br />
      <br />
      write about these problems in the form of a list, table, infographic, or bullet points
    </p>

    <p>
      Use WebAIM WAVE to detect possible accessibility problems. do you agree with the problems detected? write a few
      sentences about your findings.

    <p>
      Before you start your hi-fi prototypes, create a visual design style guide (e.g., in Figma) that displays the main
      colors, typography, and reusable componentsâ€™ different states
      (buttons on hover, click, etc.)

      Major components should be included in your style guide, but how many components this totals to will vary based on
      your design choices. For interactive elements (e.g., elements that change on hover, on click), keep their
      interactions consistent throughout your product to keep the user experience coherent. You may find using Figma
      components helpful for reusing components in your hi-fi prototype.
    </p>

    <p>
      mockups: Using Figma or other mockup tool (like Adobe XD), create a total of 3 mockups of your screen, one for
      each of the screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). Test on a phone (~375x667px), a tablet (~768x1024px) and a
      large computer (~3840x2160px), but your interface should work on any dimensions within that range! You are
      encouraged to sketch out how you may lay out the components before making the mockups; this will actually save you
      time from having to change your mockups. Design a website that is actually responsive: reusing most of it between
      screen sizes, rather than designing three fairly different interfaces for different screen sizes.

      For each mockup, annotate the different elements so that a developer would be able to take your designs and
      reproduce them without needing additional explanation. Note elements used and key layout choices that are not the
      default (e.g., whether something is flex, or alignment attributes, or non-obvious margin/padding, or setting
      width/max-width). Annotate how your website would be responsive to handle the different screen sizes. Is it clear
      how the styling and/or structuring of each element will change when you move from desktop to mobile to tablet?
      Here are some example questions to consider annotating:
      For larger containers, will you be using flexbox, grid, or something else? Why?
      When in-between sizes, will anything like fonts or spacing need to be adjusted slightly?
      Does the page change because of a user-action (such as a click or a hover)? How?
