    <p id="intro">
      this study was about learning how real people use real interfaces. i looked at the printers in my uni's campus
      centre and adapted real users' answers into personas to study UX design flows.

    <h2 id="part-1"><span>part 1: the interface <a href="personas#whole-title" class="top-link">back to
          top</a></span></h2>

    <p>
      first i inspected the interface myself and sketched out its interactive parts.
    </p>

    <div class="ac-img-compact-box">
      <img class="ac-img-compact" src="assets/personas/printer_interface.jpg"
        alt="Ballpoint sketch of the printer touchscreen and card swipe interface" />
    </div>
    <p class="caption">Printer touchscreen and swipe interface</p>

    <p>
      most students use the touchscreen and card swiper attached to the printer.<br />
      <br />
      the screen presents a streamlined process, which makes sense as
      there can be a lot of traffic through the area between classes. some "obvious" questions aren't
      answered: what should I swipe? where? students learn the answers pretty quickly, so the interface doesn't try to
      teach them.<br />
      <br />
      there are some peripheral options like "Check Status", but the most popular option is front and centre: swipe to
      log in, then view your printer queue.
    </p>

    <div class="ac-img-compact-box">
      <img class="ac-img-compact" src="assets/personas/swipe_interface.jpg"
        alt="Close-up sketch of the card swipe element" />
    </div>
    <p class="caption">Close-up of card reader interface</p>

    <p>
      the card reader is simple: engraved symbols show an up/down motion, and
      an
      image of a card shows the magnetic strip pointing toward the middle slot. i thought the symbol might
      indicate the correct way to swipe my card, but actually both ways worked.<br />
      <br />
      the position of this element provides context to the screen's interface, answering the question of where to swipe.
      this is also a pretty common setup across campus (like at the mailroom nearby), so more context prepares users for
      this interaction.
    </p>

    <h2 id="part-2"><span>part 2: the interaction <a href="personas#whole-title" class="top-link">back to
          top</a></span></h2>

    <p>
      for this part, i sat in the lobby while people walked up to use the
      printers. i made some quick notes and sketches, and asked a few students some questions for my project.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      there were some common points of confusion/friction: <br />
      <br />
      users tended to be pressed for time and focused on efficiency when using the interface. it was generally
      straightforward but they found some irritating points they had to adapt to. because of the repetitive interactions
      around campus, users habitualise quickly.<br />
      <br />
      some users had a very smooth experience, swiping without looking at the
      instructions and collecting their prints. <br />
      <br />
      others were more hesitant: not sure about which printer to
      use, reading the screen, swiping, and then looking over the buttons on the touchscreen. some stood at the printer
      with their laptops, not sure how to send the print job in the middle
      of the interaction.<br />
      <br />
      i asked some usrs about their experience:
    </p>

    <ol class="left-numlist" style="padding-right: 25px;">
      <li><b>why are you using this interface?</b></li>
      they want to: print my class readings/print my essay. mostly only a few pages. always printing their whole queue
      (they didn't have any documents queued up they were saving for later).
      <br /><br />
      <li><b>when do you normally use these printers?</b></li>
      they go: just before the class where the assignment is due/whenever i'm in the area/in the afternoon when there's
      no queue.
      <br /><br />
      <li><b>is there anything you had to get used to when you used this for the first time?</b></li>
      they had to adjust to: the QR codes on the printers/which printers i can use if i want to print colour vs B&W/how
      to access my queue.
      <br /><br />
      <li><b>is there anything you wish you could do with this interface?</b></li>
      users want to: check my printer balance/preview and edit print jobs/access printing instructions/rest my laptop by
      the printer to check the job.
      <br /><br />
      <li><b>does anything confuse you about this interface right now?</b></li>
      they were confused: when the touchscreen exits the printing app and they can't see the login screen/by all the
      buttons after they log in/by the visual hierarchy on the screen.
      <br /><br />
      <li><b>is this interface better or worse than any other printers you've used? Why?</b></li>
      users said: i like my home printer because i can plug in my laptop/i don't like signing in to things/queueing up
      for the printer is frustrating because others don't know what they're doing.
    </ol>

    <p>
      I used the observations from previous parts to construct 2 personas. I'm mapping out their basic characteristics
      with something called an <em>empathy map</em>, which sets out how the persona would/what they would think, feel,
      say or do while using the printer interface.
    </p>
    <!-- 
      - use observations to create 4-quadrant empathy maps of what users think/feel/say/do for two archetypal character.
      --- describe user in one sentence
      --- point out the interface problems people face
      --- explain why and how a given persona represents the users of your chosen interface

      Late Larry is taking 5 classes and they're all on Monday-Wednesday-Friday. He just finished his
      homework for a class starting in 2 minutes and his professor wants a physical copy on her desk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Late Larry is affected by the ambiguity between colour and B&W printers, because if he knew that he could print
      B&W on colour printers and not get charged he'd likely switch over. The lack of surfaces to put his laptop on is
      also a problem here, as well as the inaccessibility of printing instructions and the unclear/non-obvious QR code
      for the Printing Guide.<br />
      <br />
      He combines some of the issues that commonly affect first-time users, who struggle to guess what exactly the
      interface wants from them and suffers from the brevity-clarity balance that it chooses.

      Tedious Tiffany is in a leadership position for the "Loving Him Was Brown" club on campus. She spends a lot of
      time arranging events and there's a big listening party coming up, so she needs to print a lot of posters to put
      up around campus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tiffany has issues with the lack of extra information and customisability options on the printer, as she is unable
      to change her printing settings to fit her unique situation (printing posters) or check up on her printing money
      balance from the interface.<br />
      <br />
      Tedious Tiffany represents the users who have non-standard needs from the printer interface and end up having to
      jump through lots of extra hoops to get something like a batch print done.

    </h2>

    <p>
      Finally, I created a storyboard to reflect the interaction of my persona Late Larry with the printer interface.
    </p>

    <img class="ac-img" alt="Storyboard page 1" src="assets/personas/storyboard_1.jpg" />

    <img class="ac-img" alt="Storyboard page 2" src="assets/personas/storyboard_2.jpg" />

    <p>
      This storyboard helped me to flesh out the persona I had created and envision how the design problems with my
      chosen interface can affect people's real lives.<br />
      <br />
      Overall, this project was a useful exercise for thinking about design in context. Thank you for reading!
