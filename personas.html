      This case study is about studying real people using real interfaces and adapting my findings into personas
      to apply when building storyboards and designing user flows. I'll learn how to illustrate user needs and
      experiences
      based on interviews and observations.

    <p>
      The interface I've selected is the public printer at Brown's Page Robinson Hall, at the centre of campus.
      <br />
      <br />
      I inspected the interface myself and sketched out its interactive parts.
    </p>

    <div class="ac-img-compact-box">
      <img class="ac-img-compact" src="assets/personas/printer_interface.jpg"
        alt="Ballpoint sketch of the printer touchscreen and card swipe interface" />
    </div>
    <p class="caption">Printer touchscreen and swipe interface</p>

    <p>
      The interactive element of the printer for most students is the attached touchscreen and card swipe element at
      the
      front of each printer.<br />
      <br />
      The screen presents simple options to try and streamline the process as much as possible, which makes sense as
      there can be a lot of traffic through the area (especially during classes), with multiple students lining up to
      print their documents. They go for brevity instead of clarity here, as some "obvious" questions aren't
      answered: what should I swipe? Where? It's assumed that any student trying to print their homework already
      knows that they should have their student ID card ready. <br />
      <br />
      The interface provides peripheral options like "Check Status", but centres the most frequent option, which is to
      swipe, log in, and view your personal printer queue.
    </p>

    <div class="ac-img-compact-box">
      <img class="ac-img-compact" src="assets/personas/swipe_interface.jpg"
        alt="Close-up sketch of the card swipe element" />
    </div>
    <p class="caption">Close-up of card reader interface</p>

    <p>
      The card reader is a simple interface with engraved symbols on the plastic face indicating up/down motion, and
      an
      image of a card with the magnetic strip pointing toward the slot in the middle. I thought the symbol might
      indicate which way round the card should be swiped to be read correctly, but both ways worked.<br />
      <br />
      Placing this component right next to the touchscreen may help with the unanswered question on the initial page,
      as
      it should be visible to users who aren't sure what their first step is. The environment of the interface also
      helps: right around the corner is the mailroom, which contains similar card reader interfaces all over the
      place.
    </p>

    <h2 id="part-2"><span>part 2: the interaction <a href="personas#whole-title" class="top-link">back to

    <p>
      For this part, I sat in the Page-Robinson lobby and worked at my computer while people walked up to use the
      printers. I made quick notes and sketches, and stopped some students to see if I could ask them a few questions
      for my project.

      I noticed some common points of confusion or friction, especially when I started to ask people my interview
      questions. Users tended to be pressed for time and focused on efficiency when using the interface, and found it
      generally straightforward but with some sticking points that they adapted to after several uses but maybe still
      found irritating. The interface is highly similar to other interactions they have to do multiple times every day
      on campus, so the user experience is habitualised over time.<br />
      <br />
      Some users I saw had a very smooth experience, walking right up to the printer, swiping without looking at the
      screen/instructions, and collecting their prints. Others were more hesitant, first not sure about which printer to
      use, reading the screen, swiping, and then pondering which button to press on the touchscreen to complete their
      task. Others stood by the printer with their laptops, trying to figure out how to send the print job in the middle
      of the interaction.<br />
      <br />
      I asked some of the users a few questions about their experience with the printers.
    </p>

    <ol class="left-numlist" style="padding-right: 25px;">
      <li><b>Why are you using this interface?</b></li>
      People all tended to answer these questions in similar ways. Students want to print their readings, or essays for
      a weird professor who doesn't accept digital submissions. They only had one or two documents to print; and none
      had any documents in their printing queue that they <em>didn't</em> want to print straight away (so all were using
      the "Print all" button).
      <br /><br />
      <li><b>When do you normally use these printers?</b></li>
      Obviously the answers to this question were dependent on when <em>I</em> was at Page-Robinson, but I went at two
      separate times to try and even out my results a little. The 10-minute gaps between class slots were really busy.
      The people I spoke to tended to go either when it was most convenient (e.g. if they happened to be at
      Page-Robinson between classes, or already at the mailroom), or deliberately visited the printers when they thought
      others <em>wouldn't</em> be there (to avoid queues).
      <br /><br />
      <li><b>Is there anything you had to get used to when you used them for the first time?</b></li>
      One person I spoke to found the QR codes on the printers confusing at first, and weren't sure whether there was
      some additional step they had to scan to complete before printing. It also wasn't immediately clear which printer
      you are allowed to use if you're trying to print in colour vs. black & white &mdash; in fact, some people I
      saw/spoke to still seemed confused about this, waiting for the black & white printer when the colour printer was
      available.
      <br /><br />
      <li><b>Is there anything you wish you could do with this interface?</b></li>
      I heard from some people that it would be useful to be able to check their printer balance from the touchscreen.
      People also complained that there's no way to edit the details of a print or preview it before running the job:
      one asked, "what's the point of having a screen on the printer if you can't do that?" Another point that came up
      was seeing instructions on how to start print jobs before starting the interaction. Lastly, some complained there
      was no place to rest your laptop or device while printing.
      <br /><br />
      <li><b>Does anything confuse you about this interface right now?</b></li>
      Some noted that when starting the interaction the touchscreen doesn't always open on the right app, which makes it
      difficult to navigate to the dialog for logging in/starting to print. After you swipe your card, it can still be
      confusing to select the right button for the print function they want. I think the size/salience of each button
      could be improved to make the most frequent actions more obvious.
      <br /><br />
      <li><b>Is this interface better or worse than any other printer interfaces you've used? Why?</b></li>
      One person said it was worse than their home printer because at home they could just plug in their computer. They
      were very anti-signing in to things, and found the physical connection much more practical. The queue for the
      printer was also annoying for people, especially having to watch less experienced users work out how to use the
      online printing function in real time (while standing in front of the printer). It seems like the interface's
      efforts at streamlining don't always work.
    </ol>

      I used the observations from previous parts to construct 2 personas. I'm mapping out their basic characteristics
      with something called an <em>empathy map</em>, which sets out how the persona would/what they would think, feel,
      say or do while using the printer interface.

      Late Larry is taking 5 classes and they're all on Monday-Wednesday-Friday. He just finished his
      homework for a class starting in 2 minutes and his professor wants a physical copy on her desk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Late Larry is affected by the ambiguity between colour and B&W printers, because if he knew that he could print
      B&W on colour printers and not get charged he'd likely switch over. The lack of surfaces to put his laptop on is
      also a problem here, as well as the inaccessibility of printing instructions and the unclear/non-obvious QR code
      for the Printing Guide.<br />
      <br />
      He combines some of the issues that commonly affect first-time users, who struggle to guess what exactly the
      interface wants from them and suffers from the brevity-clarity balance that it chooses.

      Tedious Tiffany is in a leadership position for the "Loving Him Was Brown" club on campus. She spends a lot of

      up around campus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tiffany has issues with the lack of extra information and customisability options on the printer, as she is unable
      to change her printing settings to fit her unique situation (printing posters) or check up on her printing money
      balance from the interface.<br />
      <br />
      Tedious Tiffany represents the users who have non-standard needs from the printer interface and end up having to
      jump through lots of extra hoops to get something like a batch print done.

    <p>
      Finally, I created a storyboard to reflect the interaction of my persona Late Larry with the printer interface.
    </p>

    <img class="ac-img" alt="Storyboard page 1" src="assets/personas/storyboard_1.jpg" />

    <img class="ac-img" alt="Storyboard page 2" src="assets/personas/storyboard_2.jpg" />

    <p>
      This storyboard helped me to flesh out the persona I had created and envision how the design problems with my
      chosen interface can affect people's real lives.<br />
      <br />
      Overall, this project was a useful exercise for thinking about design in context. Thank you for reading!
